# Python for BrickPi3

This repository contains a Python build which supports the Raspberry Pi architecture used by the BrickPi3.
The Python version in this repository (3.10) is several versions ahead of the version offered by Dexter Industries
(3.5, released in 2015 and no longer supported). Newer Python versions offer performance and syntax improvements
and are easier to support, since users would not need to worry about which features are available.

Before installing this version, check whether you actually need to by running `python3` in the terminal and
observing the output. To install this version of Python over the previous one, move the contents of this repository to

```
/usr/local/lib/python3.10
```
